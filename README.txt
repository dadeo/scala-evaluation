This project is an evaluation of Scala using existing Java technologies.

The goal of this project is to prove that a team that is currently using
Java Technologies would be able to switch over to Scala while retaining
the technologies that they are already familiar with.

Technologies:
    X maven
    X fitnesse
    X html unit
    X spring mvc
      cas
      hibernate
